    <h1>LAGUNA</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>The Province of Laguna, which was formerly called La Laguna and La Provincia de la Laguna de Bay, was named after Laguna de Bay, the body of water that forms its northern boundary. Laguna de Bay, in turn, was named after the town of Bay (Laguna de Bay is Spanish which means "Lake of Bay"), the first provincial capital.</p>

    <h2>Geography</h2>
    <p>Laguna covers a total area of 1,917.85 square kilometres (740.49 sq mi) occupying the north‑central section of the CALABARZON region in Luzon. The province is situated southeast of Metro Manila, south of Rizal, west of Quezon, north of Batangas and east of Cavite.

Laguna lies on the southern shores of Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the country. On the southern border of the province are Mount Makiling and Mount Banahaw, both are long dormant volcanoes, but still sources of geothermal energy. Mount Makiling is popular for the numerous hot spring resorts that are found on its slopes. Pagsanjan Falls, is a popular waterfall that tumbles down a deep gorge in the hills.

The eastern portion of Laguna straddles the southernmost portions of the Sierra Madre mountain range.</p>

        Based on the 2010 Census of Population and Housing (CPH), the province of Laguna posted a total population of  2,669,847 persons as of May 1, 2010.  This is larger by 703,975 persons compared to its total population of 1,965,872 persons counted in the 2000 CPH.  The increase in the population count from 2000 to 2010 translated to an average annual population growth rate (PGR) of 3.11 percent.  This is lower than the 3.67 percent annual PGR of the province between the census years 1990 and 2000.
